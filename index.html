<p>Students every year have issues finding friends as they may not have met anyone on their college campus. 
  The students who suffer from this problem the most are freshmen, however, even upper-level transfer students may have issues making friends in their classes. 
  This problem presents itself on and around the UofSC campus and many college campuses around the world. 
  This problem matters because many universities try to make their students feel at home when making a large change, such as moving from a different city or even another state entirely.</p>
